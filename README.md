## What is The Youtube Miniplayer
The Youtube Miniplayer is an alternative miniplayer to the inbuilt browser miniplayer. Having a youtube video open and multitasking can be very good, and a miniplayer is probably the most efficient way to do achieve this. By having a flexible miniplayer that is non dependant on other windows, The Youtube Miniplayer is ideal for any user. Using electron js and a chrome extension, the process is as seamless as ever, on par or even better than the inbuilt browser one.

## What was wrong with the inbuilt miniplayer
The inbuilt miniplayer was a great addition to the browser, however it has its fair share of problems. One big problem I saw was handling ads. While watching youtube, it is inevitable that you will also watch an ad. With the inbuilt miniplayer, there is no way to skip the ad. Instead, you have to disable the miniplayer, skip the ad in your browser window, and then re-enable the miniplayer. 

Another problem with the inbuilt miniplayer was the lack of controls. The inbuilt miniplayer only lets you pause and unpause a video. There is no way to adjust the volume, increase the speed, enable closed captions, or fast forward without having to interact with the browser first and then re-enabling the miniplayer

## What does The Youtube Miniplayer Solve
The Youtube Miniplayer functions similarly to the in built browser miniplayer with some key differences. First being the addition of controls. Unlike its browser's counterpart, The Youtube Miniplayer has the full series of controls such as volume, time, closed captions, and more. Likewise, with this full access, skipping ads or playing other videos is simple with no need to close the miniplayer ever.
